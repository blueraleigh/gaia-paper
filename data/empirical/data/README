landgrid.gpkg: 

    The gridded land surface was created by first constructing a discrete global
    grid (implemented in the dggridR package) using the icosahedral equal area
    projection at resolution level 4 and intersecting this with Earth's land
    mass. The resulting spatial polygon was then modified manually in QGIS to
    split multipart polygons that spanned water bodies or merge adjacent small
    polygons into a single larger one.

    Use this dataset with care, as several of the borders are disputed.

    The original shapefile (world_borders.zip, 3.2 MB) was downloaded from the Mapping Hacks website:
    http://www.mappinghacks.com/data/

    The dataset was derived by Schuyler Erle from public domain sources.
    Sean Gilles did some clean up and made some enhancements.
